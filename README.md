# Hello-World
A starter must little program
I am suppose to make some changes here as for my first commit.
Ok, I am going to tell you a little bit about myself. I am a college freshmen majoring in electrical and computer engineering. But I also like coding a lot, and I want to go a little deeper with it than just what my major provides me with. As you can tell from my writing, I am not much of a writer. And I should mention English is my second language, but the sad thing is I am starting to forget my first language, how lame is that? Anyway, I got big plans with what I am starting now. I will make it there slowly no matter what it takes.
